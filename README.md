# ONYX upgrade tester
Arabic RTL application for independent per-screen ERP upgrade tests, configurable test forms, execution results, approvals and evidence. Preserves original React/Vinext, TypeScript, Tailwind, Drizzle and Cloudflare architecture.

## Development
Requires Node >=22.13.0 (CI Node 24), pnpm 11.25.0. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then `pnpm dev`. Build using `pnpm run build`; `pnpm start` runs the built Worker locally. Run `pnpm test`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `git diff --check`. Keep the original lockfile. Tests use Node SQLite and ephemeral databases; never use production data.

## Services and configuration
Retain `.openai/hosting.json` for original Site appgprj_6abd87c86b04819183fa71a0a95de282. The deployed app relies on Sites trusted ChatGPT authentication headers, Cloudflare D1 binding DB and R2 binding BUCKET. Configure ONYX_OWNER_EMAIL as a server secret for the verified owner; `.env.example` contains placeholders only. Apply checked-in drizzle migrations to the correct environment using its approved deployment process; db:generate generates migrations and does not apply them. Never copy live database/bucket contents into Git. Provisioning, credentials, service data and authentication infrastructure were not migrated. Independent production operation outside Sites has not been verified and requires a trusted authentication gateway and equivalent bindings.

GitHub is the development authority. Reviewed GitHub changes must be explicitly handed back to the existing Sites source for later authorized publication; no automatic deployment is configured. Site identity, audience and hosting remain unchanged.

## Governance and provenance
Read AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and docs/worklog.md. Initial source import is Issue #1 / PR to develop; main contains only bootstrap until a separate release PR. Existing lint failures block merge; see worklog. Feature limitations are documented in docs/form-builder-guide.md.

## Original project documentation
# vinext-starter

A clean full-stack starter running on [vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext), with optional Cloudflare D1 and Drizzle support.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- Portable: Windows, macOS, or Linux; no Bash required
- Managed Linux: managed Linux runtime with Bash, `flock`, `curl`, `sha256sum`, and GNU `timeout`
- Git is required only for publishing

## Sites Lifecycle

The Sites initializer copies the shared starter and selects managed-linux only when `SITES_MANAGED_LINUX_CONTAINER=1`; otherwise it selects portable. It saves the selection only in ignored `.sites-runtime/execution-profile.json`. Both profiles copy/configure first, then use the plugin's separate `install-dependencies.mjs` step to measure installation independently. Edit source under `app/` and follow the Sites skill for installation, preview, builds, and publishing.

Run `node <plugin-root>/scripts/configure-execution-profile.mjs` only when the profile is unknown for the current checkout and environment. Profile changes do not alter tracked source or require reinstalling otherwise-valid dependencies; restart an existing preview to use the new selection. Do not commit or upload `.sites-runtime/`.

This starter does not use `wrangler.jsonc`.

`install:ci` runs `npm ci` once against the shared lockfile, disables parent-workspace discovery, and includes required dev/optional dependencies despite production/omit settings. Sharp defaults to prebuilt binaries unless explicitly configured otherwise. Do not overlap installers.

- **Portable:** Preserve host HOME, npm cache, registry, proxy, temporary paths, retry/concurrency settings, and lifecycle-script policy. Use `--prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund`.
- **Managed Linux:** Use the existing project-local HOME/cache/tmp setup and Linux install lock, tarball preflight, and timeout. Restore the image-seeded npm cache only when its lockfile hash matches; retain network fallback. Builds keep their existing timeout. These helpers are not invoked by the portable profile.

`scripts/sites-env.mjs` preserves the caller's HOME, npm cache, proxy, XDG, and temporary-directory configuration while defaulting Wrangler and Miniflare state to the checkout. If npm reports an unwritable cache, select a writable path with `npm_config_cache` for that install. The `dev` and `start` scripts also keep Wrangler logs inside the checkout. Generated `.sites-runtime/` and `.wrangler/` directories are disposable and ignored by Git.

On portable, `npm run dev` uses `vinext dev` with HMR, starting at port 5173. Vinext records the running server in ignored `.vinext/` state, rejects an ordinary duplicate launch, and recovers stale state after a stopped process; exactly simultaneous starts can race. Pass `--port <port>` or `--hostname <host>` after `npm run dev --` when needed; keep portable previews on loopback.

For browser QA on managed Linux, use `sites-preview start`. The project's dev script runs Vite and accepts the supervisor's `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173 --strictPort` arguments. The internal browser uses `http://terminal.local:4173/`; it is not a user-facing URL. The supervisor owns the preview lifecycle. The ignored local profile survives the supervisor's cleared process environment.

The portable profile simulates ChatGPT sign-in only for loopback development requests. Visit `/signin-with-chatgpt?return_to=/` to sign in as `local_seedy` (`seedy@sites.test`, display name `Seedy`) and `/signout-with-chatgpt?return_to=/` to sign out. The development cookie preserves that identity across server restarts. Mock auth is disabled in the managed-linux profile and is not included in production builds; hosted authentication remains dispatch-owned.

The Worker uses `vinext/server/fetch-handler`, including Vinext's config-aware image handling. After building, `npm start` runs that Worker locally through Wrangler on `127.0.0.1`, sharing `.wrangler/state` with dev preview and local D1 migrations; it does not deploy the site or simulate sign-in. Use the URL printed by the server. Pass `npm start -- --port <port>` to select a different built-preview port.

Local previews use Miniflare's placeholder `Request.cf` metadata without a network lookup. Set `CLOUDFLARE_CF_FETCH_ENABLED=true` to opt into fetching preview metadata; this setting does not change hosted request metadata.

Local tool usage metrics are disabled by default. Set `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=true` to opt in.

## Included Shape

- edit site code under `app/`
- `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` provides optional dispatch-owned ChatGPT sign-in helpers
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares optional Sites D1 and R2 bindings
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development
- `db/index.ts` reads the D1 binding from the Cloudflare Worker environment
- `db/schema.ts` starts intentionally empty
- `@cloudflare/workers-types` provides Worker types; `cloudflare-env.d.ts` declares optional `DB`/`BUCKET` bindings—update these declarations if binding names change
- `examples/d1/` contains an optional D1 example surface
- `drizzle.config.ts` supports local migration generation when needed

## Workspace Auth Headers

Signed-in visitors receive both `oai-authenticated-user-id` and `oai-authenticated-user-email`. Private Sites require every visitor to sign in; public Sites may also have anonymous visitors, for whom neither header is present.

The user ID is stable for the same user on the same Site and different across Sites. Use it as the durable user key; use email and name for display or contact purposes.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive `oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty `name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by `oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const userId = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-id");
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Optional Dispatch-Owned ChatGPT Sign-In

Import the ready-to-use helpers from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` when the site needs optional or required ChatGPT sign-in:

- Use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI.
- Use the returned `userId` as the stable user key for user-owned records; do not use email as a durable identifier.
- Use `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` for server-rendered pages that should send anonymous visitors through Sign in with ChatGPT.
- In a Server Component, start sign-in with `<a href={chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)} target="_top">`. The auth helper module is server-only; do not import it into a Client Component.
- Do not use `fetch`, XHR, a client-side router, or a framework link that can prefetch the sign-in route. SIWC must start as a top-level navigation.
- Never request the AuthAPI authorization endpoint directly. The dispatch-owned `/signin-with-chatgpt` route must start the SIWC flow.
- Use `chatGPTSignOutPath(returnTo)` for browser sign-out links or actions.
- Pass a same-origin relative `returnTo` path for the destination after sign-in or sign-out. The helper validates and safely encodes it.
- Mark protected pages with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because they depend on per-request identity headers.

Dispatch owns `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, `/callback`, the OAuth cookies, and identity header injection. Do not implement app routes for those reserved paths. Routes that do not import and call the helper remain anonymous-compatible.

SIWC establishes identity only; it does not prove workspace membership. Use the Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions, or enforce explicit server-side membership or allowlist checks.

Use SIWC for account pages, user-specific dashboards, saved records, and write actions tied to the current ChatGPT user. Leave public content anonymous.

## Local D1 migrations

For a D1-backed local preview, generate SQL with `npm run db:generate`. Build once through the Sites skill's build entrypoint (or `npm run build` for standalone use) to generate `dist/server/wrangler.json`, rebuilding if bindings change. From the project root, apply each pending migration in order:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/sites-env.mjs ./node_modules/wrangler/bin/wrangler.js d1 execute DB --local --config dist/server/wrangler.json --persist-to .wrangler/state --file drizzle/0000_example.sql
```

Replace the filename with the pending migration and `DB` with your D1 binding name if different. Use `.wrangler/state`, not `.wrangler/state/v3`; Wrangler adds the versioned directories. Do not replay migrations already applied locally. This updates only the preview database; publishing applies production migrations separately.

## Diagnostic Commands

- `npm run install:ci`: perform the one locked dependency install
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite/Vinext development server
- `npm run build`: build the deployable Sites artifact
- `npm run start`: preview the built Worker locally with D1/R2 support
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes

When using the Sites plugin, follow its skill instructions for installation, builds, and publishing. These npm commands remain available for standalone use.

The portable build runs Vinext directly without a host `timeout` command. The managed-linux build uses `scripts/build-verified.sh` and its existing `SITES_BUILD_TIMEOUT` setting.

## ONYX application permissions and form setup

`ONYX_OWNER_EMAIL` is a required server environment secret in Sites, initialized from the verified Site owner. The first authenticated owner request binds the dispatcher-provided stable Site user ID in D1. Other configured accounts bind on their first authenticated visit; unknown or inactive accounts are rejected. Every data API checks the requested operation and allowed ONYX system, including evidence download. Form and user records do not modify Sites sharing or send invitations. Changes to the hosting audience require a separate explicit instruction.

D1 stores app users, legacy screen fields, full per-test form definitions, append-only form revisions, results and preparation data. The full editor selects a verified system, screen and test. Every existing builtin field can be configured; stable source screen identities, authenticated user values, uploaded files and original source references retain their meaning. Custom fields are inherited from previous screen configurations until a test has its own saved definition. The original source workbook content stays unchanged; instruction edits are per-test overrides.

The shared renderer is used by preview, execution and preparation. Designers can edit field labels, instructions, placeholders, compatible types, defaults, options, required flags, width, order and visibility. They can duplicate custom fields, undo/redo local changes, restore builtin defaults and load an earlier saved revision for review before saving. Required core fields retain their visibility; saved custom fields are hidden rather than removed so values remain available. Custom field types and groups can change, with values checked against their new definitions on the next save. Limit: 100 custom fields per test. The legacy screen-only API remains compatible with previous clients.

Result saves overwrite any client-provided tester with the authorized current user's name and record their stable Site identity and email. The owner display name is decoded from the trusted platform header only when its encoding is declared; the stored name or email is the fallback. Preparation can be saved as a draft; declaring readiness validates the currently visible required fields. If a changed form introduces missing required fields, the UI marks earlier preparation as needing review. Required execution inputs and required evidence attachments are enforced on terminal statuses. Hidden values remain saved. Optimistic versions prevent concurrent overwrites. Form changes and their revision snapshots are written in one atomic D1 batch; a history failure rolls back the form update.

Local preview has a development-only identity on exact local hosts, compiled out by the Vite production build. The ignored `.env` is used only for local configuration; `.env.example` documents the key without a value. Local QA accounts and data are never packaged with the Site.

Validation: `node tests/model.mjs`, `node tests/enhancements.mjs`, and `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`. The integration suite uses in-memory SQLite and simulated platform identities to verify durable operations and permission rejection, without touching production data.
